The Desk Slot Booking system is a Python-based application developed to streamline the process of reserving desks in an college environment. 

This project allows users to view available desks, make reservations, and manage bookings with ease. The application features a command-line 

interface that interacts with a local database to track desk availability and user reservations. It is designed to optimize college space usage 

and improve booking efficiency. The project makes use of Pythonâ€™s rich standard library for file handling and database management, ensuring 

reliable and scalable performance.</pre>
